### Hi, I'm Jasmin 👋

I'm currently a doctoral researcher in Political Science at the University of Hamburg. I'll finish my PhD in the end of this spring and I'm looking for new challenges and tasks where I can use the skills I've learned in the last years. 

**What I love to do**   

🕵🏻‍♀️ Searching for patterns in data   
📈 Thinking about statistical ways to analyze whether these patterns tell a true story   
📊 Finding beautiful ways to tell these stories   
👨‍💻👩🏾‍💻👨🏼‍💻 And most of all, I love doing all of this in a team   

**If you are here because you are thinking about hiring me**
- My [current project](https://github.com/jasminskoenig/constitutional-regression-advanced) shows some of my most up-to-date skills in data wrangling and statistical analysis. In these papers, we analyze the effects of populists in power on courts and constitutions across countries in Europe and Latin America.
- My latest [scraping project](https://github.com/jasminskoenig/standard_clean) assembled all articles mentioning the Austrian justice system in the newspaper Der Standard. In this project I have also used the openai API with GPT-3.5 to classify articles. The data is of course not published and only used for research but you can check out the code.
- The [code](https://observablehq.com/@jasminsworkspace/constitutional-regression) for Tilko's and my [The Loop Blog](https://theloop.ecpr.eu/populists-in-power-constitutional-change-and-democratic-backsliding/) is on Observable.
- My [largest project](https://github.com/jasminskoenig/austria) is on populists in power in Austria. I've scraped all decisions and press releases from the Austrian Constitutional Court, as well as all Austrian laws. We've then analyzed whether populists in power were more likely to implement unconstitutional laws and whether the VfGH has reacted to populists in power somehow. This project has been ongoing since 2019, so it shows my earliest coding skills as well as my most up-to-date ones. It is also not finished and well organized yet but as it includes much of what I've done in the last four years, I've included it in my coding portfolio.

**If you are here because you are looking for data**
- [Data on VfGH Decisions](https://github.com/jasminskoenig/austria/tree/main). This includes a data file on the level of cases decided at the court and a dataset based on the norms reviewed by the court. It has a very large number of variables, so if you are only interested in the ones used in our EJPR paper, better check out the replication files.
- [Data on Austrian laws](https://github.com/jasminskoenig/austria/tree/main). Check out the Austrian Parliaments new [Open Data](https://www.parlament.gv.at/recherchieren/open-data/) as well. I scraped the data before the Open Data API was implemented. But, if you are looking for a dataset that has information on which laws were proposed by populist politicians, my dataset might be the way to go.
- [Variables on Judiciary in Latino- and Eurobarometer](https://github.com/jasminskoenig/barometer/tree/main/data). This is particularly interesting for people studying trust in the judiciary since the current harmonized dataset of the Eurobarometer lacks quite a few years for this variable.
- [Combination of V-Dem, V-Party, Comparative Constitutions, Euro- and Latinobarometer Data](https://github.com/jasminskoenig/constitutional-regression-advanced/blob/main/data/ccpc_vdem.rds)
